### NOTE: this example is for studying the breast cell line MCF7 ###
###   to chenge the target, simply replace "MCF7" with your target   ###  

#open a linux/unix bash

#create the folder structure to accomodate cell type MCF7
mkdir MCF7
mkdir MCF7/seq
cd MCF7/seq

#go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds

#paste the following at NCBI Geo DataSets
MCF7[All Fields] AND "breast"[All Fields] AND "Homo sapiens"[porgn] AND "gse"[Filter] AND "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"[Filter]

Send the results to file Summary (text) -> save as gds_result_seq.txt in MCF7/seq

#isolate series ID 
grep '^Series' gds_result_seq.txt | perl -ne '/Accession: (GSE\d+)/;print $1,"\n"' > GSE_seq

#the GSE_seq file will guide the download script GSE_download.R
